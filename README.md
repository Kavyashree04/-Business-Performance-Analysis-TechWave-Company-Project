Business Performance Analysis – Fictional Company Project

 Project Overview:

This project is based on a fictional business case where I took the role of a Data Analyst for a company experiencing declining profits despite strong sales.
The CEO tasked me with investigating the issue, uncovering the root causes, and providing actionable insights.

The focus was to let the data tell the story — from cleaning raw inputs to building an interactive dashboard that delivers clear business insights.


Scope of Work:

Data Cleaning – Preparing raw data for analysis by removing errors and inconsistencies.
Data Analysis – Identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies.
Data Visualization – Designing an interactive Power BI dashboard.
Data Storytelling – Presenting insights in a way that’s easy for executives to act upon.


 
 Situation:

Over recent months, TechWave recorded its highest-ever sales volume — yet profits fell by 10%, resulting in financial losses despite the growth in revenue.



 Discovery & Analysis:

Example Insights from the Dataset:

January – Sales were steady, profit margins were healthy. Laptops sold 1,200 units at $600 each.

March – Price was reduced to $500, boosting sales to 1,500 units — but the cost per unit stayed high.

Result – Increased sales volume did not improve profits. In fact, higher production costs eroded margins.




 What I Did:

1. Cleaned the dataset — fixed missing values, corrected data types, ensured data accuracy.
2. Performed EDA — spotted anomalies, cost surges, and profit dips.
3. Created KPI — Total cost
4. Built Visuals — Bar charts, Line charts, Key influencers chart and Performance gauges to reflect key metrics.
5. Designed Dashboard — focused on delivering “what’s happening and why” rather than overloading with unnecessary visuals.




 Key Findings:

Root Cause: Declining profit margins due to rising costs combined with reduced selling prices.
Performance Indicator: Gauge chart showed profits well below the target range.
Cost Impact: Higher costs are consuming profit margins, creating long-term risk if not addressed.




 Tools Used:

Power BI – For data cleaning, modeling, visualization.
Fictional Dataset – Self-created to simulate real-world analysis.




 Conclusion:

The analysis clearly showed that low selling prices and increased production costs were the key drivers of the company’s profit decline.
A strategic focus on price optimization and cost control could reverse the trend and restore profitability.
This fictional case study allowed me to practice real-world business analytics, from raw data cleaning to executive-ready storytelling that focuses on decision-making over data complexity.
